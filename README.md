SQL Practical Assignment – Brief Write-


This assignment focused on testing essential SQL skills within a simulated educational institution’s database environment. The primary objective was to create and manipulate a student records database using SQL operations via Google Colab with SQLite.

Key steps completed in the assignment included:

Database and Table Creation:

A new database was established with a students table, structured to store each student’s ID, name, age, gender, enrollment date, and program.


Data Insertion:
Five student records were inserted, showcasing a diversity of names, programs (including at least one in "Data Science"), ages, and enrollment details.


Data Querying:

SQL queries were written to:

Retrieve all students enrolled in the "Data Science" program.

Calculate and display the total number of students enrolled.


SQL Function Usage:

Built-in SQL functions were used to:

Display the current date under a custom column.

Present student names in uppercase alongside their enrollment dates.


Advanced SQL Queries:


Further analysis included:
Counting the number of students in each program, sorted by descending frequency.
Identifying the youngest student’s name and age.

All SQL code was tested in Google Colab using Python’s sqlite3 library for execution and pandas for results display. The assignment reinforced practical database management skills, efficient query construction, and the application of SQL functions for everyday data analysis tasks.
